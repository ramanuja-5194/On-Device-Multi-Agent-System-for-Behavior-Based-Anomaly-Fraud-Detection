# System Architecture

## Overview

Guardio employs a sophisticated multi-agent architecture designed for real-time behavioral anomaly detection. The system operates entirely on-device, ensuring complete privacy while providing enterprise-grade security monitoring.

## Core Components

### 1. Agent Layer
- **Movement Agent**: Tracks and analyzes mouse movement patterns
- **Typing Agent**: Monitors keystroke dynamics and timing patterns
- **AppUsage Agent**: Observes application focus behavior and switching patterns

### 2. Processing Layer
- **Statistical Analysis Engine**: Implements exponential moving averages and z-score calculations
- **Queue Management System**: Handles inter-agent communication
- **Threading Controller**: Manages concurrent agent execution

### 3. Presentation Layer
- **Samsung One UI Dashboard**: Professional interface with real-time monitoring
- **Alert System**: Dynamic risk scoring and notification management
- **Configuration Panel**: Live sensitivity and cooldown adjustment

## Data Flow Architecture

```
User Behavior → Agents → Statistical Analysis → Risk Assessment → UI Display
↑                                                                ↓
└── Adaptive Learning ← Profile Updates ← Anomaly Detection ←──┘
```

## Threading Model

Each agent operates in its own thread to ensure:
- **Non-blocking operation**: UI remains responsive
- **Concurrent monitoring**: Simultaneous behavioral analysis
- **Scalable architecture**: Easy addition of new agents

## Privacy Design

- **Local Processing**: All data remains on user device
- **No External Communication**: Zero network dependencies
- **Memory Efficient**: Minimal data storage requirements
- **Secure by Design**: No behavioral data persistence
